# Overview

The goal of this site, as a huge fan and player/DM of Dungeon's and Dragons (D&D), is to create something that I felt would be really handy and beneficial to supplement the game's experience. 

Dungon Club allows the user to achieve the following:
* Quickly look up Character Races/Classes/Spells and other rules/information, via a dataset created from the official D&D SRD. This is a free-use document for the creation of content based around the subject of D&D. 
* Choose from a list of official Source/Campaign books, with cover art, descriptions and links to purchase.
* Sign up for a secure account to gain access to a Profile area. This profile allows the user to create quick cards for all the characters for their games, and also a Quest To-Do list, to keep track of their in-game objectives. The site also has functionality to securely delete their account as they see fit.

# UI/UX
